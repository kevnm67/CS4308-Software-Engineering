# CS4308assignment1 #

## Assignment ##
Write a program in your “favorite” language that will accept numerical numbers as inputs, compute the average, and output the answer. (This problem-statement is purposely left a bit “vague” for you to think about and restate the problem ---- e.g. What if the input is non-numeric? or How accurate should the answer be? )

Turn in your:

-  enhanced problem statements, 
-  program listing 
-  “some proof” via testing that it works.
## Setup ##

Run `bin/setup`

This will:

 - Install the gem dependencies
 - Install the pod dependencies

## Testing ##

Run `bin/test`

This will run the tests from the command line, and pipe the result through
